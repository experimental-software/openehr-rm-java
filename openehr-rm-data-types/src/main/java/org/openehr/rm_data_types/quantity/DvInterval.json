    "description": "Generic class defining an interval (i.e. range) of a comparable type. An interval is a contiguous subrange of a comparable base type. Used to define intervals of dates, times, quantities (whose units match) and so on. The type parameter, `T`, must be a descendant of the type `DV_ORDERED`, which is necessary (but not sufficient) for instances to be compared (`_strictly_comparable_` is also needed)."
